Using languages for a person who attains little information on their family origin is why this will be a difficult project to complete.  Yet, since 2014 I know it does help with a variety of information and in a System Build it could be a benetit.  I know it works easily for European ancestery and so part of that information could be accessed within 1 - 2 years on a simple workbench on a website.  

Good Issues:  European people for centuries have enjoyed the luxury of well founded history of their Surnames and family genetic history.  However, the true intent of trylike is to help those people enjoy the same privileges as Europeans without a 7th CE surname to claim.  It is the intention of the System Build to pull as many possible leads to a persons history as possible.  Adding search and translations, digital language libraries, and network mapping to view onsite gegraphical locations as part of redeveloping the refactor needed from the abuse of the slave trade, and/or adoptions with no real history, and Native Americans who need the additional help.

This project is intended to provide insight to a person's historical surname history.  A combined effort to upgrade the system build for Genetic Surname list will be part of the selector for clients who choose to add that option.  It's highly recommended to test in your  country of choice.  Getting your Genetic evidence out of the country to a secured location is the clients own responsibility.  We will NOT mail color envelopes for you to swab for any type of testing, and if you purchase that option to test we are not responsible for the product, testing, or admixture found on any of the buccal swabs used for DNA testing and results.

Any issues are cloned to trilike.  This repository is reserved for when the project is completed and fully polished for business.  Please see trilike responsitory for problems, errors, bug fixes git add, commits, and push.

I must admit the Tech world is not easy.  A past problem with people can cause this project to have several problems, but since I passed my Python class the project has become more than buggy, its been at times a harassing non stop issue.  Therefore the more people who contribute to Languages helping people, the more likely it will be a success!  Just keep it positive and NOT positively inmature.
