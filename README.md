Demo for TryLike "Project 1":  

Begin: The Shughnan High Pamirs.  
Problem: Genetics can't verify accurately the timeline.  
Solution: Discovering migration with TryLike "Project 1"

How: My system discovery in Chinese: "From Shaghnan" 
It is to say Migration directed towards the Sariqoli in North East China. 
The how did I develop this action?  Is why implementing TryLike "Project 1" is credible. 

Why: Without Persian, Arab or Turk for Afghanistan we can implement the missing link here as a alternative application. 
Other: Nuclear DNA is Ladakh, India - China to Kazan Russia?  Why guess?  The allele is stripped being too old, 
or lost its traction!  Besides, my medical evidence supports the "hard ear wax" found in the Peking man, not European Arab or Persian.

TryLike "Project 1" combines a 50 volumn library as a missing link between Genetic Distribution versus egocentric interests.  This dubious success is no mistake! 

The work ahead is like this:  Its fully understood that an advanced civilization exits!  Its not appreciated to use 1980's code language as a move forward.  Ouch!  I'm not flattering myself - its yuck!

About programming Project 1: Currently learning code language.  Projects here require employed developers.
